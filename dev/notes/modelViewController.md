# Understanding Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## A Real-World Analogy: The School Play

Imagine organizing a school play. To manage complexity, you divide responsibilities into three key areas:

### 1. Model (The Story)

- Contains the plot and characters
- Manages what happens in the play
- Holds all core information

### 2. View (The Stage)

- Handles visual presentation
- Includes stage setup, props, and costumes
- Controls what the audience sees

### 3. Controller (The Director)

- Coordinates all activities
- Manages transitions and timing
- Ensures smooth interaction between story and stage

## MVC in Programming

The Model-View-Controller pattern follows similar principles:

### Model

- Stores program data
- Handles business logic
- Manages information state

### View

- Presents data to users
- Manages user interface
- Controls visual elements

### Controller

- Processes user input
- Updates model and view
- Coordinates system flow
